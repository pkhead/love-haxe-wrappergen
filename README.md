This project uses the awesome [love-api][] project, which provides a lua tables representation of the love documention, to generate Haxe wrappers.
To use this project, make sure to checkout the submodule (`git submodule update --init love-api`).

Fair warning, the code is awful, and full of hacks. Look, it was easy.
